 - Datasets
The project is based  one dataset: event_data. The directory of CSV files partitioned by date. Here are examples of filepaths to two files in the dataset:

event_data/2018-11-08-events.csv
event_data/2018-11-09-events.csv

- Prject include Jupyer notebook process the event_datafile_new.csv.

- Modeling of NoSQL database or Apache Cassandra database


## Executive Summary

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

thus they hire a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring you on the project. The role is to create a database for this analysis. As and data engineer you will be able to test your database by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.




## How to Install & Run the Project

Design tables to answer the queries outlined in the project template

Write Apache Cassandra CREATE KEYSPACE and SET KEYSPACE statements

Develop the CREATE statement for each of the tables to address each question

Load the data with INSERT statement for each of the tables

Include IF NOT EXISTS clauses in your CREATE statements to create tables only if the tables do not already exist. Also include DROP TABLE statement for each table, this way you can run drop and create tables whenever you want to reset your database and test your ETL pipeline
Test by running the proper select statements with the correct WHERE clause
